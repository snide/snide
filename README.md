### Hello, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹

Hello random visitor. My name is Dave Snider. I've been working with computers in some form or another since the early 90s when I hacked away on an old IBM PS2 and a pre-www Prodigy account. Since then I've mostly fiddled around on the Internet building websites for myself, Elastic, CNET, or CBS.

I enjoy designing through code and these days start most projects with a commit rather than a mock. I love open source, and tend to contribute or sponsor anything I personally use. My daily tools are:

- [Arch Linux][15] with [Gnome][14] is my desktop
- [Neovim][9] is my editor
- [Fish][10] is shell
- [Alacritty][11] for a terminal
- For navigating around I enjoy [nnn][2], [fzf][3], and [bat][4]

You might know me from these open source projects where I was a significant contributor.

- [Elastic UI][1] - The React design system that powers Elastic.
- [Kibana][5] - Charts and things!
- [Webhook CMS][6] - An early (2013!) Jamstack (This wasn't even a word yet!) CMS you can reminisce about on [Vimeo][8].
- [Read the Docs][7] - I get a kick that my theme work powers the Linux kernal docs.

For you video game nerds, I am also _that Dave Snider_ from [Giant Bomb][12] (the website about videogames). You can read more about what I'm up to on my [personal website][13].
